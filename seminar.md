# USTC complex geometry seminar

This is the homepage of a complex geometry seminar organized by [Mingchen Xia](readme.md) at USTC, Hefei. If you wish to visit USTC and give a talk, please contact Mingchen.

## Forthcoming talks

Title: Recent progress on the SOS conjecture

Time: Sep. 19, 2025 (Friday) 10:00~11:00 

> Abstract: In this talk, we will introduce our recent progress on the study of the SOS conjecture (proposed by Ebenfelt), which is closely related to the Huang-Ji-Yin gap conjecture in the study of rational proper maps between the complex unit balls. This is based on joint work with Chenlong Yue and Professor Xiangyu Zhou.

Title: Around the unique ergodicity of holomorphic foliations

Time: Sep. 11, 2025 (Thursday) 10:00~11:00 

> Abstract: Holomorphic foliations are geometric structures to foliate high dimensional complex manifolds with low dimensional ones (called leaves). The key problem in this area is to study the density and the distribution of leaves. Fornaess-Dinh-Nguyen-Sibony proved that in compact Kahler surfaces, foliations with only hyperbolic singularities admits unique ergodicity. In particular, if the foliation does not direct any positive closed currents, then there is a unique (up to scaling) positive harmonic current directed by it. As a consequence, each leaf is dense and has the same distribution in the sense of Nevanlinna currents.
In this talk I will introduce the basic concepts about holomorphic foliations, hyperbolic singularities, harmonic currents. I will review the unique ergodicity, and talk about my result on the Lelong number of directed harmonic currents. Finally, I will talk about some open problems.
