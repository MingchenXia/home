Title: On the existence of weighted-cscK metrics

Time: Oct. 10, 2025 (Friday)  10:00-11:00

> Abstract: Weight-cscK metrics provide a universal framework for the study of canonical metrics, 
e.g, extremal metrics, Kahler Ricci soliton metrics, \mu-cscK metrics. In joint works with Yaxiong Liu, 
we prove that on a Kahler manifold X, the G-coercivity of weighted Mabuchi functional implies the 
existence of weighted-cscK metrics.  In particular, there exists a weighted-cscK metric if X is a 
projective manifold that is weighted K-stable for models.  We will also discuss some
progress on singular varieties.

Title: Maximal destabilizers for Chow and K-stability

Time: Oct. 30, 2025 (Thursday)  

> Abstract: When Kahler manifold (X, L) admits cscK metrics, Donaldson uses the balanced metrics to quantize the cscK metrics. In the opposite case, if (X, L) is K-unstable, then the Kodaira embedding of X via |kL| would be Chow-unstable when k is large enough. In this case, we have a maximal K-destabilizer due to Xia and Li, and a sequence of maximal Chow-destabilizers due to Kempf. A natural question is whether the latter will converge to the former in a certain sense. We propose a variational approach based on Boucksom-Jonssonâ€™s non-Archimedean pluripotential theory. We shall start with the toric setting, where things become very concrete.

Title: Recent progress on the SOS conjecture

Time: Sep. 19, 2025 (Friday) 10:00~11:00 

> Abstract: In this talk, we will introduce our recent progress on the study of the SOS conjecture (proposed by Ebenfelt), which is closely related to the Huang-Ji-Yin gap conjecture in the study of rational proper maps between the complex unit balls. This is based on joint work with Chenlong Yue and Professor Xiangyu Zhou.

Title: Around the unique ergodicity of holomorphic foliations

Time: Sep. 11, 2025 (Thursday) 10:00~11:00 

> Abstract: Holomorphic foliations are geometric structures to foliate high dimensional complex manifolds with low dimensional ones (called leaves). The key problem in this area is to study the density and the distribution of leaves. Fornaess-Dinh-Nguyen-Sibony proved that in compact Kahler surfaces, foliations with only hyperbolic singularities admits unique ergodicity. In particular, if the foliation does not direct any positive closed currents, then there is a unique (up to scaling) positive harmonic current directed by it. As a consequence, each leaf is dense and has the same distribution in the sense of Nevanlinna currents.
In this talk I will introduce the basic concepts about holomorphic foliations, hyperbolic singularities, harmonic currents. I will review the unique ergodicity, and talk about my result on the Lelong number of directed harmonic currents. Finally, I will talk about some open problems.
