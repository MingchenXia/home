Welcome to my homepage

## About me
I am now an assistant professor at Tsinghua University, Yau Mathematical Sciences Center (2021.9-). Before that, I was a Hill assistant professor (postdoc) at Department of Mathematics, Rutgers University-New Brunswick (2018.9-2021.6). My postdoc mentor is Yi-Zhi Huang. I received my Ph.D degree at Vanderbilt University in 2018, advised by Vaughan Jones.

My name in Chinese: 归斌/歸斌

##  Research Interests

I'm interested in the mathematical areas that are related to two-dimensional Conformal Field Theory, including:  Algebraic Quantum (Conformal) Field Theory, Vertex Operator Algebras, Subfactors and Operator Algebras, Tensor Categories.
