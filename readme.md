## About Me

I am now a post-doc at [IMJ-PRG](https://www.imj-prg.fr). My mentor is [Sébastien Boucksom](http://sebastien.boucksom.perso.math.cnrs.fr).
I obtained my PhD in [Chalmers Tekniska Högskola](https://www.chalmers.se/sv/Sidor/default.aspx) in Sweden under the supervision of Robert Berman.

My name in Chinese: 夏铭辰(Simplified)/夏銘辰(Traditional)

Email: <mingchen@imj-prg.fr>

Office: Jussieu 1516-504.

I'm currently working on singular metrics on arithematic varieties. Updated on February 5, 2023.

## Some Problems

This is a collection of problems arising from my own research that may be of interest to people outside my domain.  If you know the solutions to any of the following problems, please let me know.

- [Flat pull-back of currents on complex analytic spaces](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/407628/regularity-of-fiber-integration-between-complex-analytic-spaces)

- [Compute mixed volumes of big line bundles from Okounkov bodies](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/408179/mixed-volumes-of-newton-okounkov-bodies)

> By [a theorem of Jow](https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.2521), information of all Okounkov bodies determines all numerical information of line bundles. This problem asks for explicit formulae.

## Notes

- [Relative pluripotential theory](Notes/RPT.pdf) (Chapter I to Chapter III)

> Just a preliminary version with potentially many mistakes. I'm slowly adding new materials.

- [Radial Calabi flow](Notes/RCF.pdf)  

> One of my unfinished projects. It contains a number of conjectures of interest.

- [Pluripotential theory on complex analytic spaces](Notes/PTV.pdf)

> This is not a research article. I simply want to provide a reference for my work in progress about pluripotential theory on polyhedral spaces.

- [Note on $L^2$-methods in global pluripotential theory](Notes/MIS.pdf)

> My personal notes when learning the $L^2$ methods, I plan to include more details in the future. This note contains an example of a reverse Bertini theorem, which seems to be new.

- [Note on relative normalisations](Notes/RN.pdf)

> I collect a few well-known results about relative normalisations.

- Notes on the toroidal compactifications of Shimura varieties: [I](Notes/SV1.pdf), [II](Notes/SV2.pdf), [III](Notes/SV3.pdf), [X](Notes/SV10.pdf), [XIII](Notes/SV13.pdf).

> I'm organizing a seminar about Ash--Mumford--Rapoport--Tai. I will try to write more notes in the near future.

- Notes on Katz--Mazur [I](Notes/KM1.pdf).

> My personal notes on Katz--Mazur. I want to refomulate everything in the language of stacks.

- [Hausdorff convergence properties of partial Okounkov bodies](Notes/HCP.pdf).

> I fully answered the conjecture about partial Okounkov boides in my paper. I haven't decided yet if this should be written as a paper or a note.

- Notes on Hodge theory: [Carlson's correspondence](Notes/Hodge1.pdf).

- Notes on unipotent nearby cycles: [Nearby cycle and vanishing cycle](Notes/VC.pdf).

## Research

All of my preprints can be found on arXiv. See [my Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=1GbYhEMAAAAJ) as well.

### K-stability

- On sharp lower bounds for Calabi type functionals and destabilizing properties of gradient flows, ***Analysis & PDE***, (2021).  [arXiv:1901.07889](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07889) [Journal link](https://msp.org/apde/2021/14-6/p12.xhtml)

- Pluripotential-theoretic stability thresholds, ***IMRN***, (2022).  [arXiv:2012.12039](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12039) [Journal link](https://academic.oup.com/imrn/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/imrn/rnac186/6644735)

### Pluripotential theory

- Integration by parts formula for non-pluripolar product.  [arXiv:1907.06359](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06359)

> This paper was the first proof of the integration by parts formula. However, a better approach was found later on by Lu, so this paper is no longer important. I don't intend to submit it.

- Mabuchi geometry of big cohomology classes with prescribed singularities. [arXiv:1907.07234](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07234)

> [This](/Papers/MG.pdf) is a much better version. I corrected a few mistakes. I will upload this version to arXiv when the paper is accepted.

- The closures of test configurations and algebraic singularity types, (joint with Tamás Darvas), ***Advances in Mathematics***, (2022).  [arXiv:2003.04818](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04818) [Journal link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870822000147)

- The volume of pseudoeffective line bundles and partial equilibrium, (joint with Tamás Darvas). [arXiv:2112.03827](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03827)

- Partial Okounkov bodies and Duistermaat--Heckman measures of non-Archimedean metrics. [arXiv:2112.04290](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04290)

> [This](/Papers/POB.pdf) is a better version than the arXiv version. Several typos are fixed, and several additional references are added. There are two mistakes in the arXiv version: 1. <span style="color:red"> In Section 4, the standing hypothesis should be that the classes are big instead of pseudo-effective. </span> 2. <span style="color:red"> In most parts of the paper, GLS(D) needs to be replaced by GLS(D)', where we require that the valuative semigroup generates the full lattice as well. The mistake was origninally in Theorem 3.13, where I forgot to consider the normalization of the volume measure in KK12.</span> These mistakes do not affect any of the results and are fixed in this version.

> The Hausdorff convergence property is proved in full generality in my note [Hausdorff convergence properties of partial Okounkov bodies](Notes/HCP.pdf).

- A transcendental approach to non-Archimedean metrics of pseudoeffective classes, (joint with Tamás Darvas and Kewei Zhang). [arXiv:2302.02541](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02541)

### Non-Archimedean geometry and algebraic geometry

- On Liu morphisms in non-Archimedean geometry, ***Israel Journal of Mathematics, (2022)***. [arXiv:2106.08032](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08032) [Journal link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11856-022-2456-6)

- Analytic Bertini theorem, ***Mathematische Zeitschrift***, (2022).  [arXiv:2110.14971](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14971) [Journal link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00209-022-03103-7)

### Number theory

- Non-pluripolar products on vector bundles and Chern--Weil formulae on mixed Shimura varieties. [arXiv:2210.15342](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15342)

> In [this version](/Papers/CW.pdf), I removed the unnecessary recalling of the mixed Shimura varieties and the third part in order not to distract the readers. They will appear elsewhere. I am still working on the arithmetic applications of the techniques developped in this paper. <span style="color:red"> I corrected the definition of $I_k(h)$, which is wrong in the arXiv version. The proof of 13.2 is not rigorous in the arXiv version, but the result is correct. I will put the correct proof in a forthcoming paper. </span>
