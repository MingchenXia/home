## About me

I'm now a Hill assistant professor (postdoc) at Department of Mathematics, Rutgers University-New Brunswick. I received my Ph.D degree at Vanderbilt University, advised by Vaughan Jones.

##  Research Interests

I'm interested in the mathematical areas that are related to two-dimensional Conformal Field Theory, including:  Algebraic Quantum (Conformal) Field Theory, Vertex Operator Algebras, Subfactors and Operator Algebras, Tensor Categories.

## Notes

- [Notes on Conformal Blocks](Files/2020_Conformal_Blocks.pdf) (Main body finished. Preface and many references to be added soon. I'm now working on the last chapter discussing some basic properties of the connections on sheaves of conformal blocks.)


> In this monograph we give a complex-analytic approach to the theory of conformal blocks for VOAs developed by (e.g.) Frenkel & Ben-Zvi [[FB]](https://math.berkeley.edu/~frenkel/BOOK/) and further explored by Damiolini-Gibney-Tarasca [[DGT1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06981) [[DGT2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04683).
