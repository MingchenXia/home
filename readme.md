## About Me

I am now a post-doc at [IMJ-PRG](https://www.imj-prg.fr). My mentor is [Sébastien Boucksom](http://sebastien.boucksom.perso.math.cnrs.fr).
I obtained my PhD in [Chalmers Tekniska Högskola](https://www.chalmers.se/sv/Sidor/default.aspx) in Sweden under the supervision of Robert Berman.

My name in Chinese: 夏铭辰(Simplified)/夏銘辰(Traditional)

Email: <xiamingchen2008@gmail.com>

Office: Jussieu 1516-504.

Thanks to the french efficiency, I am an illegal immigrant in France now. <span style="color:red"> I will not be able to accept any offline talk/conference/workshop invitation in 2024. </span> 

I'm currently interested in Hodge modules and the Japanese language. Updated on November 23, 2023.

## Some Problems

This is a collection of problems arising from my own research that may be of interest to people outside my domain.  If you know the solutions to any of the following problems, please let me know.

- [Flat pull-back of currents on complex analytic spaces](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/407628/regularity-of-fiber-integration-between-complex-analytic-spaces)

- [Compute mixed volumes of big line bundles from Okounkov bodies](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/408179/mixed-volumes-of-newton-okounkov-bodies)

> By [a theorem of Jow](https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.2521), information of all Okounkov bodies determines all numerical information of line bundles. This problem asks for explicit formulae.

## Notes

- [LaTeX tips for working mathematicians](Notes/LaTeX_tips.pdf)

- [Relative pluripotential theory](Notes/RPT.pdf) (Chapter I to Chapter III)

> Just a preliminary version with potentially many mistakes. I'm slowly adding new materials.

> One of my unfinished projects. It contains a number of conjectures of interest.

- Pluripotential theory on complex analytic spaces

> This is integrated into the arXiv version of my paper on Mabuchi geometry. So I disabled the link.

- [Note on $L^2$-methods in global pluripotential theory](Notes/MIS.pdf)

> My personal notes when learning the $L^2$ methods, I plan to include more details in the future. This note contains an example of a reverse Bertini theorem, which seems to be new.

- [Note on relative normalisations](Notes/RN.pdf)

> I collect a few well-known results about relative normalisations.

- Notes on the toroidal compactifications of Shimura varieties: [I](Notes/SV1.pdf), [II](Notes/SV2.pdf), [III](Notes/SV3.pdf), [X](Notes/SV10.pdf), [XIII](Notes/SV13.pdf).

> My personal notes on Katz--Mazur. I want to refomulate everything in the language of stacks.

- [Hausdorff convergence properties of partial Okounkov bodies](Notes/HCP.pdf).

> I fully answered the conjecture about partial Okounkov boides in my paper. I haven't decided yet if this should be written as a paper or a note.

- Notes on Hodge theory: [Carlson's correspondence](Notes/Hodge1.pdf).

- Notes on unipotent nearby cycles: [Nearby cycle and vanishing cycle](Notes/VC.pdf).

- [Operations on transcendental non-Archimedean metrics](Notes/OTNA.pdf). [arXiv:2312.17150](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17150)

> This note is submitted to the proceeding for Bo Berndtsson's 70th birthday. It is a trivial continuation of my joint paper with Darvas and Zhang. The only notable result is Theorem 4.21. This is slightly different from the arXiv version. A few typos are corrected. <span style="color:red"> A minor mistake in Section 4 is corrected. </span> I will upload the revision to arXiv later on.

## Research

>Errare humanum est.

All my preprints can be found on arXiv. See [my Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=1GbYhEMAAAAJ) as well.

### K-stability

- On sharp lower bounds for Calabi type functionals and destabilizing properties of gradient flows, ***Analysis & PDE***, (2021).  [arXiv:1901.07889](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07889) [Journal link](https://msp.org/apde/2021/14-6/p12.xhtml)

> My note [Radial Calabi flow](Notes/RCF.pdf) might be of interest to the readers of this paper.

- Pluripotential-theoretic stability thresholds, ***IMRN***, (2022).  [arXiv:2012.12039](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12039) [Journal link](https://academic.oup.com/imrn/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/imrn/rnac186/6644735)

> In arXiv version 1, Section 8, I briefly explained the second order expansion of Donaldson's L-functionals, which might be of interest as well.

> I'm always curious about Conjecture 9.2 in this paper (there is an obvious typo, L should be [\omega] instead): Is it true that a general geodesic ray (with respect to a transcendental class) of finite entropy is necessarily maximal (in the sense that the Legendre transform is always I-model)? Please contact me if you know how to prove/disprove it.

### Pluripotential theory

- Integration by parts formula for non-pluripolar product.  [arXiv:1907.06359](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06359)

> This paper was the first proof of the integration by parts formula. However, a better approach was found later on by Lu, so this paper is no longer important. I don't intend to submit it.

- Mabuchi geometry of big cohomology classes with prescribed singularities, ***Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik***, (2023). [arXiv:1907.07234](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07234) [Journal link](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/crelle-2023-0019/html)

>  There is a slight issue in the proof of Theorem 2.11 line 10: <span style="color:red"> $f^{\#}$ is only formally smooth, not smooth. </span> This does not affect anything in the proof. This is corrected in [this version](Papers/MG.pdf).

> The published version contains only the special case without prescribed singularities on Kähler manifolds. The method in the general case is exactly the same.

- The closures of test configurations and algebraic singularity types, (joint with Tamás Darvas), ***Advances in Mathematics***, (2022).  [arXiv:2003.04818](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04818) [Journal link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870822000147)

- The volume of pseudoeffective line bundles and partial equilibrium, (joint with Tamás Darvas). [arXiv:2112.03827](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03827)

- Partial Okounkov bodies and Duistermaat--Heckman measures of non-Archimedean metrics. [arXiv:2112.04290](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04290)

> [This](/Papers/POB.pdf) is a better version than the arXiv version. Several typos are fixed, and several additional references are added. There are two mistakes in the arXiv version: 1. <span style="color:red"> In Section 4, the standing hypothesis should be that the classes are big instead of pseudo-effective. </span> 2. <span style="color:red"> In most parts of the paper, GLS(D) needs to be replaced by GLS(D)', where we require that the valuative semigroup generates the full lattice as well. The mistake was origninally in Theorem 3.13, where I forgot to consider the normalization of the volume measure in KK12.</span> These mistakes do not affect any of the results and are fixed in this version.

> The Hausdorff convergence property is proved in full generality in my note [Hausdorff convergence properties of partial Okounkov bodies](Notes/HCP.pdf).

- Non-pluripolar products on vector bundles and Chern--Weil formulae on mixed Shimura varieties. [arXiv:2210.15342](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15342)

> [This](/Papers/CW.pdf) is the revised version. A few minor mistakes are corrected.  

- Transcendental Okounkov bodies, (joint with Tamás Darvas, Rémi Reboulet, David Witt Nyström and Kewei Zhang). [arXiv:2309.07584](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07584)


### Non-Archimedean geometry and algebraic geometry

- On Liu morphisms in non-Archimedean geometry, ***Israel Journal of Mathematics, (2022)***. [arXiv:2106.08032](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08032) [Journal link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11856-022-2456-6)

> In the complex analytic setting, very similar arguments (using Fréchet algebras instead of Banach algebras) give the notion of Stein morphisms. It is of interest to see if these morphisms are useful.

- Analytic Bertini theorem, ***Mathematische Zeitschrift***, (2022).  [arXiv:2110.14971](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14971) [Journal link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00209-022-03103-7)

- A transcendental approach to non-Archimedean metrics of pseudoeffective classes, (joint with Tamás Darvas and Kewei Zhang). [arXiv:2302.02541](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02541)

> The theory of non-Archimedean psh functions we developed in this paper trivally satisfies Boucksom--Jonsson's envelope conjecture (even on a general unibranch complex space), see my note [Operations on transcendental non-Archimedean metrics](Notes/OTNA.pdf).
