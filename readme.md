##  Research Interests

I'm interested in the mathematical areas that are related to two-dimensional Conformal Field Theory, including:  Algebraic Quantum (Conformal) Field Theory, Vertex Operator Algebras, Subfactors and Operator Algebras, Tensor Categories.

## Notes

- [Notes on Conformal Blocks](Files/2020_Conformal_Blocks.pdf) 


> In this monograph we give a complex-analytic approach to the theory of conformal blocks for VOAs. Part of this note is adapted and form the main body of my article *Convergence of sewing conformal blocks*.
